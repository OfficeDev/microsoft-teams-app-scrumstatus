 Scrum Status bot is a simple scrum assistant bot that will enable users to run asynchronous stand-up meetings and provide and easy way for the users to share their daily updates. It is designed to work in Teams group chats and all the members can contribute to the scrum. One can start and end a scrum and can view the updates made by others in a running scrum.

The bot works best in typical corporate workforce scenarios, where the team members are not confined to a specific geographic region, span across multiple time zones and are more diverse and remote in nature. Most often than not, in such cases it is difficult for all the members within a team to get together in a room daily and share their updates.

An end-user interacting with Scrum Status Bot:
